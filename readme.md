# Giphy Voice

You are a **live streamer** using OBS ( Open Broadcaster Software ) and you are
looking to **increase followers** on your stream.
And you don't want to spend money, because reasons and
also the internet should be free!

Streamer's Voice

Supported Input Types

 1. Microphone
 2. Twitch Chat

WHAT ARE BROWSER SOURCES?
Browser Sources can be added to your scenes of your streaming software and enable you to use web based content such as Flash and JavaScript applications, websites and so on and even customize them via css. Since this kind of content is usually not written in the same coding languages as your streaming application, a translator is needed to make it possible for both to communicate with each other.
