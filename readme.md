#### What is an OBS Browser Source?

Browser Sources can be added to your scenes of your streaming software and
enable you to use web based content such as Flash and JavaScript applications,
websites and so on and even customize them via css. Since this kind of content
is usually not written in the same coding languages as your streaming
application, a translator is needed to make it possible for both to
communicate with each other.
