#### What is an OBS Browser Source?

Browser Sources can be added to your scenes of your streaming software and
enable you to use web based content such as Flash and JavaScript applications,
websites and so on and even customize them via CSS. Since this kind of content
is usually not written in the same coding languages as your streaming
application, a translator is needed to make it possible for both to
communicate with each other.

## Build Website Landingpage

You will not need to do this as it is only a tool used for building the
landing page on the PubNub Website.
This will build `./build/dashboard.html` and copy source to your clipboard.
You can see a live version of the
[Twitch TV OBS Subtitles Browser Source](https://www.pubnub.com/developers/twitch-tv-obs-subtitles/) page.
