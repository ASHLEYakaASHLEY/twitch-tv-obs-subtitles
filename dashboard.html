        <h2>Why PubNub makes OBS Plugins Better</h2>
        <p>
            PubNub provides data transfer from one app to another app.
            In the case of the subtitles captured for Twitch TV,
            your web browser app is sending data to your OBS app.
            Essentially your computer is sending data to
            itself between two apps.
            Your voice is being transcribed in your web
            browser using your microphone.
            The resulting transcription is transmitted
            into the OBS Browser Source.
        </p><p>
            Imagine now you can send data directly into OBS
            and create entirely new online live experiences.
            You, or a friend, can use your an iPad to draw 
            action lines on your live stream.
            You can give remote control to channel mods to manage 
            your screen display and make minor changes.
            So many cool things can happen now.
        </p><p>
            PubNub can send data to anywhere.
            More than just sending data from
            one app into another app on the same computer.
            PubNub can send data to other computers nearby.
            It can even send data to computers around the world.
            Anywhere the internet exists, data can be transferred.
        </p><p>
            PubNub can broadcast data from one app into all other apps.
            Millions of apps all-at-once, and even more beyond that.

        <h2>Modern Closed Captioning ( Subtitles )</h2>
        <p>
            Live TV traditionally required a human in a TV studio to
            transcribe spoken voice and sounds on TV.
            The studio transcriber's job is to listen to the live video
            feed and as quickly and accurately as possible type the
            transcription into a computer terminal which appends the closed
            captioning directly into the Television Signal.
            The technical job title is a "stenographer".
        </p><p>
            During a live broadcast of a special event or of a news program,
            captions appear just a few seconds behind the action to show
            what is being said.
            A <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question427.htm">stenographer</a>
            listens to the broadcast and types
            the words into a special computer program that adds the captions
            to the television signal.
        </p>

        <h2>Closed Captioning is a Slow Process</h2>
        <p>
            This captioning can only go as fast as a human can
            process information.
            The average reaction time of a human is is 215 milliseconds,
            according to the data collected so far.
            In addition to your reaction time, there is additional
            latency of your computer and the internet.
        <p></p>
            However it takes longer to determine the spoken words and
            then type these into a computer terminal.
            Your experience is seeing a delay of 4-8 seconds.
            Humans are creating the transcriptions,
            and errors are prone to happening.
        </p>

        <h2>Now we have Artificial Intelligence and it's Taking our Jobs</h2>
        <p>
            Yes it is true.
            AI is taking jobs and very soon the stenographer
            will be completely artificial.
            You will get to take advantage of this technology right now,
            further aiding the succession of artificial intelligence.
        <p></p>
            This is the future and early AI is starting to take jobs
            from humans.
            This is a real world example of this.
            OBS Subtitles is a perfect example of AI taking a human job.
            Instead of hiring a transcriber (stenographer) while you stream,
            you can have a robot do it for, at no extra cost.
